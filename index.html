Welcome to 𖤂.com.<br>
<br>
I'm Alex Chung.<br>
<br>
I own this domain name.<br>
<br>
Ideally, I'd use it as a redirect to my personal site, alexchung.com, but Google Chrome marks this domain name funny because it is an Internationalized Domain Name (or IDN).<br>
<br>
So here it sits. I love it though. 𖤂.com. How cool is that?<br> 
<br>
If you want to see something really cool, go to alexchung.com.<br>
