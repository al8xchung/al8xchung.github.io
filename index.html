Welcome to 𖤂.com.<br>
<br>
I'm Alex Chung.<br>
<br>
I own this domain name.<br>
<br>
Ideally, I'd use it as a redirect to my personal site, alexchung.com.<br>
<br>
But Google Chrome considers this domain name sus because it is an Internationalized Domain Name (or IDN).<br>
<br>
So here it sits. I love it though. 𖤂.com. How cool is that?<br> 
<br>
If you want to learn more about the guy who owns 𖤂.com, go to alexchung.com.<br>
