Welcome to 𖤂.com.<br>
<br>
I'm Alex Chung.<br>
<br>
I own this domain name.<br>
<br>
Ideally, I'd use it as a redirect to my personal site, alexchung.com.<br>
<br>
But Chrome considers this name sus because it's an Internationalized Domain Name (or IDN).<br>
<br>
And half the world uses Chrome for some reason.<br>
<br>
So here it sits. I love it though. 𖤂.com.<br> 
<br>
If you want to learn more about the guy who owns 𖤂.com, go to alexchung.com.<br>
