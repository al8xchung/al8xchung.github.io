Welcome to 𖤂.com.<br>

I'm Alex Chung. I own this domain name. Ideally, I'd use it as a redirect to my personal site, alexchung.com, but Google Chrome marks this domain name funny because it is an Internationalized Domain Name (or IDN).

So here it sits. I love it though. 𖤂.com. How cool is that? 

Come check me out, though. I am super cool.
