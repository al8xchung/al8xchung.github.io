Welcome to 𖤂.com.<br>
<br>
I'm Alex Chung.<br>
<br>
I own this domain name.<br>
<br>
Ideally, I'd use it as a redirect to my personal site, alexchung.com.<br>
<br>
But Chrome considers this name sus because it's an Internationalized Domain Name (or IDN).<br>
<br>
And 70% of the digital world uses Chrome.<br>
<br>
I thought doing this (hosting a site directly on the domain) might help. Time will tell.<br>
<br>
So here it sits. For now.<br>
<br>
I love it though. Just look at it:<br>
<br>
<b>𖤂.com</b><br>

If you're still reading, go to alexchung.com. And mention how you found me.<br>
