Welcome to 𖤂.com.

I'm Alex Chung. I wish I could use this as a redirect to my personal site, alexchung.com, but Google Chrome marks this domain name funny because it is an Internationalized Domain Name (or IDN).

So here it sits, being beautifully wasted.

Come check me out, though. I am super cool.
